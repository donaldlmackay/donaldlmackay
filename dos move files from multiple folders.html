    <p>I have a folder with a lot of sub folders with one or more files
      in each. I am trying to write a batch file that moves all those
      files to C:\songs (for example). Any help? I have already tried </p>
    <pre><code>C:\&gt;FOR /R C:\Test %i IN (*) DO MOVE %i C:\Songs
</code></pre>
    <p>The folders Test and songs exist, but I get an error saying </p>
    <pre><code>%i was unexpected at this time. 
</code></pre>
    What am I doing wrong<br>

    <br>
    <p>i want to write 2 batch files.</p>
    <br>
    1st: batch file is eg:<br>
    <p>move all files in subdirs to root dir. eg:</p>
    <pre><code>Folder1
|_folder2
|___files.jpg
|_folder3
|___files.jpg
</code></pre>
    <p>i want to move all files in folders of folder1 to folder1</p>
    2nd batch file is eg:
    <pre><code>Folder1
|_folder2
|___JPEG
|_____files.jpg
|_folder3
|___JPEG
|_____files.jpg
</code></pre>
    <p>Need to Delete all files in sub dir then move files from JPEG one
      level up -to folder2 for example- and rename it to thumbnail.png
      for example.</p>
    <p>I tryed </p>
    <pre><code>for /r %%f in (*) do ren "%%f" thumbnail.jpg 
</code></pre>
    <p>to rename all files but dont know how to delete all files in same
      folder that containe jpeg folder and how to move files one level
      up.<br>
      -----<br>
    </p>
    <p>Here's a solution to your first question, as I understand it:</p>
    <pre><code>@echo off
setlocal
set root=Folder1
for /f "delims=" %%f in ('dir /ad /b /s %root%') do @move "%%f\*.*" %root%
endlocal
</code></pre>
    <p>As I've written it all files at any level are moved. If you only
      want first level subdirectory files moved, then get rid of the /s.</p>
    <p>For your second problem, try a similar approach, but with</p>
    <pre><code>dir /a-d /b
</code></pre>
    <p>to list all the entries that aren't sub-directories (ie, skip
      JPEG). This will let you construct the <em>for</em> statement
      that does the deletion, then do another statement that does the
      move and rename.</p>
    <p>You might want to look at calling a sub-routine to do the move,
      rename, delete. You could then manipulate the filename to change
      the name. I'm a bit confused about exactly what you want to do in
      the second case. Also have a look a the help on the <em>set</em>
      and <em>call</em> commands if your not sure about extracting the
      filename and other string manipulations.</p>

    </p>
    <br>
    I am trying to move multiple files in one directory to another<br>
    directory in DOS. Its not working.<br>
    <br>
    move "C:\temp\*.*" "D:data\files"<br>
    <br>
    The filename, directory name or volume label syntax is incorrect.<br>
    -----------<br>
    Try<br>
    move C:\temp D:\data\files<br>
    <br>
    may not be exactly what you want but it does not give you any error.<br>
    <br>
    some explanation-<br>
    I haven't used it much, I tend to use copy and then delete the<br>
    original directory.<br>
    So just playing with move, have not had much time to really see all<br>
    its workings/behaviour.<br>
    <br>
    try removing the *.*<br>
    suprisingly, it seems to cause an error, it does *.* by default<br>
    <br>
    U:\&gt;move u:\a\*.* u:\c<br>
    The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.<br>
    <br>
    another interesting thing,<br>
    when you remove the *.*<br>
    remove the backslash too, so remove \*.*<br>
    it seems that when passing directories to move, it fails, if you<br>
    follow them with a backslash.<br>
    <br>
    U:\&gt;move u:\a u:\c<br>
    <br>
    It may not matter, but you also said d:dir, it is probably better to<br>
    say d:\dir. It is fine to say d:filename I think..<br>
    <br>
    You said<br>
    move "C:\temp\*.*" "D:data\files"<br>
    <br>
    Try<br>
    move C:\temp D:\data\files<br>
    <br>
    a)removed quotes. no long filenames so not needed<br>
    b)removed *.*, that seemed to cause the error, and removed the \<br>
    before it, so the directory does not end in a backslash.<br>
    c)put a \ preceding data. e.g. directories are specified
    c:\dir1\dir2<br>
    e.t.c.<br>

    <p>The switch /Y may be present in the COPYCMD environment variable.
      This may be overridden with /-Y on the command line. Default is to
      prompt on overwrites unless MOVE command is being executed from
      within a batch script.</p>
    <h2 class="nb">Examples</h2>
    <p class="tcy">move c:\windows\temp\*.* c:\temp</p>
    <p>Move the files of c:\windows\temp to the temp directory in root,
      this is of course assuming you have the windows\temp directory.</p>
    <p class="tcy">move "computer hope" example</p>
    <p>If your directory name has a space, it must be surrounded with <a
        href="http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/q/quote.htm">quotes</a>,
      otherwise you will get a "<a

        syntax of the command is incorrect</a>." error message. In the

      directory into the example directory contained in the same
