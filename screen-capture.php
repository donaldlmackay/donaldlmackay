<h4>Take a screen capture (print screen)</h4>
<p class="indent">
You can take a picture of what is on your screen by pressing PRINT SCREEN (or PRTSCN, on some keyboards). This is called a screen capture. You can then paste the screen capture into a document, e-mail message, or other file. There are two types of screen captures you can take: the entire screen, or just the active window. For example, if you have three programs open at the same time, you might want a screen capture of only the active window.
</p>
<h4>To copy the entire screen</h4>
<p class="indent">
Press PRINT SCREEN
</p>
<h4>To copy only an active window</h4>
<p class="indent">
Press ALT+PRINT SCREEN

You can paste your screen capture into Paint, which is a drawing program you can use to crop, rotate, and resize pictures.
