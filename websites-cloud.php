<h1>Cloud files</h1>
Saving and storing a copy of your files on a server on the internet (cloud). They can then be accessed by others.
<br><br>
You can also use <a href="CloudStorageBackup.php">Cloud Storage as Backup</a> to your local hard disk.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> - This is a service that has good reviews, but with no personal experience of it, here is the company's blurb.
<br>
"Dropbox is a free service that lets you bring all your photos, docs, and videos anywhere. This means that any file you save to your Dropbox will automatically save to all your computers, phones and even the Dropbox website. Dropbox also makes it super easy to share with others, whether you're a student or professional, parent or grandparent. Even if you accidentally spill a latte on your laptop, have no fear! You can relax knowing that Dropbox always has you covered, and none of your stuff will ever be lost."</li>

<h3>Free photo sharing websites</h3>
Free photo sharing websites. For all of them you need an account with user name and password. There are 3 commonly used ones. There are others, but go with the masses and use one of these:-
<p class="indent">
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> - People uses this for all their photos.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/picasa.html">Picasa</a> - One of the ramblers uses this for his <a href="http://www.ramblers-wilts.org.uk/south_wilts/footpath.php">heavy gang photos</a> See any of the <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/N15GSR/2011AugustHeavyGangWoodgfordFPsWFOR2And3#">links</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/skydrive.html">SkyDrive</a> - This is the one <a href="http://cid-73fe6cc4e90a21ef.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/Holidays/Whitby-2011-September">I use</a>. I think the brand name is Windows Live Photos.</li>
</ul>
</p>
There seem to be fairly frequent updates (?improvements?) to everything on the web. So just when you have figured out how to use it any service, such as photo sharing, they change the rules of the game and you have to learn it all again. Nothing seems immune, so no recommendations for one because it is good, as it may be ?improved? shortly after. Ho hum...
