<h1>Yahoo email shortcuts</h1>
<div id="articleBody" class="article">
<p>Mail’s Search is poised to find anything in your entire account -
messages, attachments, names, words. Here’s how to make the most of it:</p>
<p>See the rectangular window in the upper-left corner under <span
style="font-weight: bold;">Check Mail</span> and <span
style="font-weight: bold;">Compose</span>? With a magnifying-glass
icon inside, and the words "Find messages..." That's the search window.</p>
<p>Click there and type what you're looking for - a name, a word in a
message or attachment, a Subject. If you’re really in the mood to go
turbo, use one of the shortcuts outlined below (smarty!). After you
type, click Go or press Enter.</p>
<p>A new tab opens and lists all the messages containing what you’re
looking for - even results found within attachments. Results show the
sender (From), the Subject, the Date and the Location (folder).
Underneath, they include the text surrounding the word or phrase you're
searching for. The search term itself is highlighted in <span
style="color: green;">green</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Search Shortcuts</span></p>
<p>Here are some tricks for getting exactly the result you want, quick.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Find a phrase</span></p>
<p>Put the phrase in quotes. "Bike for sale". "Desktop application".
"Practice times". Etc. Mail searches for those words - together - in
that order. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Target specific messages to reduce
clutter and time spent searching</span></p>
<p>All search shortcuts work with the minus ("-") modifier, allowing
you to remove specific messages from your search results. </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Find messages about a person (or a
company) but not from that person or company</span></p>
<p>Example: Search for messages that mention Laura, minus any that are <span
style="font-style: italic;">from</span> Laura. Type:</p>
<p>laura -from:laura</p>
<p>name(space)(hyphen)from:name </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Find messages containing an item,
but not from a specific source</span></p>
<p>Example: Search for ‘Mexico’, minus results from Greg. Type:</p>
<p>mexico -from:greg</p>
<p>(search term)(space)(hyphen)from:source</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Messages containing something, and
not containing something else</span></p>
<p>Example: Search for ‘France’ minus any results containing ‘Paris’.
Type:</p>
<p>France -Paris</p>
<p>(search term)(space)(hyphen)(item you want excluded)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use multiple shortcuts!</span></p>
<p>Combine shortcuts to really pinpoint your searches.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attachment file types, not from
certain senders</span></p>
<p>Example: Search for jpeg attachments minus any from Cindy. (Stop the
madness, Cindy!) Type:</p>
<p>attachmenttype:jpg -from:cindy</p>
<p>attachmenttype:(file type)(space)(hyphen)from:person</p>
<p>(No offense Cindy! It’s just - Hawaii was great. I get it. OK, yes.
I’m jealous!)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attachment type, linked to a
message containing a search term</span></p>
<p>Example: Find all messages containing the word you’re searching for
- say, "yellow" - that also have an mpeg movie attached. Type:</p>
<p>yellow attachmenttype:mpeg</p>
<p>(search term)(space)attachmenttype:(file type)
