3. Install OVB <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">http://www.virtualbox.org/</a><br/><br/>
4. Open OVB, then File new [Virtual Machine]<br/><br/>
5. Use ISO file to install WXP [It will be in the drop down list, if you have created a previous Machine with WXP]
<h2>Things to remember</h2>
1. Create the virtual machine calling it something like WinXP.<br/><br/>
2. As part of the process of installing Windows XP remember to format (quick format) a partition before proceeding with the rest of the installation.<br/><br/>
3. After installation complete, when prompted to "hit any key to boot from cd...", do not do this as it will redo the installation.<br/><br/>
4. When WXP is running you can pause then stop it, via virtualbox. You then close virtualbox and when you next start virtualbox, you can resume windows xp from exactly where it left off. There is a 30 day clock before registration is mandatory. It seems that by keeping WXP is running, by pausing it through Virtualbox manager, the 30 day clock is not invoked. If you have to restart XP after a shutdown then the 30 day clock is invoked and XP will not work after 30 days.<br/><br/>
5. To get shared files between WXP and windows 7 need to do 2 things:<br/><br/>
a. in OVB [the one that is running WXP]  go to devices then drop down menu: install guest additions.<br/><br/>
b. OVB manager: settings: shared folder: set a folder.<br/><br/>
6. to make the VM window fill the screen: press right Ctrl and F simultaneously<br/>
<h2>Using WXP On OVB</h2>
1. Set up virtual box shared folders to PB see "how to set up virtual box shared folders"<br/><br/>
2. Tried to run iPlayer on IE6 but would not work without upgrade of WinXP to SP2/3<br/><br/>
3. Tried to install firefox and chrome but as above upgrade needed<br/><br/>
4. Upgraded WinXP to SP2 and then run iPlayer and replay radio captured iPlayer with no difficulty.<br/><br/>
5. Project complete<br/>
