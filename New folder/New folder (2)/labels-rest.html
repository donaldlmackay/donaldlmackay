<h1>Using Microsoft Works to print address labels</h1>
<ol>
<li>Start with Microsoft Works</li>
<li>In "Choose a category" select "letters and labels" and within that select "return address and labels"</li>
<li>This then fires up Works Word and asks what kind of labels.</li>
<li>Select "Mailing labels" (which requires a data source)</li>
<li>Choose how many labels to a page. Chose 3 x 6 (3 across by 6 down)</li>
<li>You are then prompted to select data. Choose "another type of file".</li>
<li>By default you are prompted to choose a Works database.</li>
 Other choices are excel and CSV (more later). Tried excel but could not make it work. Tried database and CSV. Both worked fine.</li>
<li>If you chose database, there are quite few bits of theory needed to follow what you are doing and why. A specialist subjects for 20+ years. It is bit over the top for labels.</li>
<li>Chose CSV. It stands for Comma Separated Values.<br/>
If you take this as an example. It shows how a couple of rows of a spreadsheet appear:-<br/>
<pre>
Fuller         Andrew         Vice President, Sales         1235 Main St.  Tacoma         14222          USA
Leverling      Janet          Sales Representative          1235 Elm St.   Kirkland       14222          USA
</pre>
As CSV it appears all compressed, separated with commas:-
<pre>
"Fuller","Andrew","Vice President, Sales","1235 Main St.","Tacoma",14222,"USA"
"Leverling","Janet","Sales Representative","1235 Elm St.","Kirkland",14222,"USA"
</pre>
<li>So need to interrupt the labels in step 6 above.</li>
<li>Go back to the Spreadsheet and save it as a CSV.</li>
<li>Resume from step 6 and choose CSV.</li>
<li>Follow the prompts to complete the label.</li>
<li>Check with print preview that all looks fine.</li>
<li>Save file as Works Document (.wps)</li>
</ol>
