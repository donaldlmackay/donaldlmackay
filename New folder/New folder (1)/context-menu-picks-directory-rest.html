<h1>How to ensure context menu entries picks up directory against
  which it is right clicked</h1>
Details for the context menu are held in the windows registry. Use
the registry editor (carefully) to modify the windows registry.<br>
<ol>
  <li>Find the registry key of the program/utility e.g. "RenamerNG".
  </li>
  <li>Use regscanner, part of the nirsoft utilities set, rather than
    registry editor direct. When it finds a string and you click on
    that string, regscanner opens registry editor for that string.
    e.g.
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Directory\shell\RenamerNG\command
    with the program name (and its directory location) data field
    e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\RenamerNG\RenamerNG.exe</li>
  <li>Add %0 to the end of the data field e.g. C:\Program Files
    (x86)\RenamerNG\RenamerNG.exe %0. </li>
  <li>This %0 parameter collects the directory against which it is
    right clicked</li>
</ol>
