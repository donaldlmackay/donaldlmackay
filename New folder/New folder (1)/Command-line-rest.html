 most powerful tools in Windows, you can use it to automate processes,
run batch files, and perform troubleshooting and diagnostic tasks.</li>

 it easier to perform a command task at that folder or drive location

 "Open Command Prompt Here" option.
Now, hold the SHIFT key while you right-click the folder, and it will appear.<br>
