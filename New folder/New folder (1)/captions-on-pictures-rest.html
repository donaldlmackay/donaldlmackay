<h1>Captions on pictures</h1>
<p class="indent">
For almost everything to with images <a href="http://www.irfanview.net/">IrfanView</a> is fairly easy: You can download it from many places. A good one is
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/irfan.html">snapfiles</a><br>
<br>There are at least 2 ways to do captions in IrfanView. The default one, and another found by googling for IrfanView captions.<br>
<br>IrfanView always shows the filename at the top of the image. It calls this line with the filename, the caption. If you want to change it to something more meaningful press f2 and you can rename the image. [f2 is also the windows way of doing a rename, so you don't need IrfanView, but it is very convenient].<br>
<br>Googling for "IrfanView caption". produces a different technique. The result of this is to put the image into a frame and put a caption on the frame.<br>
<br>Here are 3 images:-<br>

<ol>
  <li><a href="stgeorge12-hp.png">stgeorge12-hp.png</a> This is the original.</li>
  <li><a href="Google-St-George-2012.png">Google-St-George-2012.png</a> This has been renamed within IrfanView using f2.</li>
  <li><a href="stgeorge12-hp%20-%20test.jpg">stgeorge12-hp - test.jpg</a> This has been put into a frame and had a caption put on the frame.</li>
</ol>

Note that you have to download the files to a computer to see the file name. If you click on the links to the pictures the name appears on the top of the browser's screen.<br>
<br>Note also that 3 is a slightly blurry image because it was saved it as 80% quality jpg. Had it been kept it as png, or 100% quality jpg, it would not be blurry. IrfanView is very configurable, so you have all sorts of border options, text font choices etc.<br>
<br>Google did not find a simple set of instructions for 3). So you need to figure it out from various websites.
