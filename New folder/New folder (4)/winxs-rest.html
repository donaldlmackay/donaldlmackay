<h1>WinXs - Unix like utilities for Windows (shareware)</h1>
Standard Windows does not provide a complete set of file and string manipulation utilities. There are plenty of 3rd party tools, but none seem to provide the single collection like WinXS.<br>
<h3>general utilities</h3>
<ul>
 <li>cksum, cal, cmp, comm,&nbsp; csplit, diff, du, file, grep, hd, more, pax, pr, sed, split, strings, tail, touch, uniq and wc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>filter programs</h3>
<ul>
 <li>cat, col, cut, dd, expand, fold, fmt, grex, nl, paste, sort and tr.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gui based</h3>
Functionally these utilities work like their unix versions. WinXS has a Gui interface, so no need to remember command options details.
<h3>Commonly Used utilities</h3>
From the lists above, these are the ones used most often.
<ul>
 <li>Cat - Concatenates files.</li>
 <li>Diff - Compares files.</li>
 <li>Grep - Scans one or more text files for a specified text string or <a href="regex.php">regular expression</a>.</li>
 <li>Split - Breaks a file up into pieces, either by number of lines or bytes.</li>
 <li>Touch - Set file modified date/time.</li>
 <li>Uniq - Writes one copy of each unique line.</li>
</ul>
