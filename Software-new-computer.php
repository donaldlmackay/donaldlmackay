<h1>Software for new computer</h1>
<br>
1. Pre-installed junk<br>
I have always got rid of most of this nag-ware. It gives you say 30 days
 or 10 uses, or some limited version that you usually don't need e.g
Symantec Norton in 1 below.<br>
<br>
Symantec Norton Internet Security. Until fairly recently, I was a great
enthusiast for AVG. Some while ago I heard about "Microsoft Security
Essentials" (MSE) http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/. I
downloaded and installed it. I also kept AVG. To my surprise they both
worked independently of each other. I had thought they would interfere,
and was surprised to have no problems.<br>
<br>
However this did not last. When AVG got more and more insistent that I
upgraded to AVG 2011 (or some such), I eventually gave in and tried the
upgrade. It failed because it objected to MSE. At this point I had to
make a decision. I don't remember the details of why I chose MSE vs AVG,
 but I probably googled and found people suggested ditching AVG. However
 the Dell (equivalent spec to the Compaq) has both MSE and AVG, with
no problems.<br>
<br>
I also have "Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy" and "Malwarebytes'
Anti-Malware". I run all 3 (these 2 and MSE) on any new software and so
far so good. All 3 seem to play together well.<br>
<br>
2. Recovery stuff - work keeping as is. Never had to use it, but re-assuring you "could" recover if needed.<br>
<br>
3. HP Setup Manager, HP Support Assistant, HP Recovery Manager, as 2 above.<br>
<br>
4. Cyberlink YouCam, Windows Live Essentials, Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash Player - keep<br>
<br>
5. Why not use widely known and used software instead or what is
provided by Windows. I use VLC. "Sent: Fri, 14 January, 2011 20:35:48
Subject: VLC (was: IT) ... The media player to use these days is VLC
http://www.videolan.org/vlc/.<br>
<br>
I use it for everything audio and video. It occupies 76MB on my laptop. I
 used it yesterday to play a .mov file. Don't be tempted to go for
Apple's Quick Time or iTunes. Quick Time was originally the only way to
play .mov. Then iTunes came along and had Quick Time incorporated. I
have given up on Quick Time but still use iTunes to download podcasts.
iTunes and Quick Time have bloated as Apple keep on adding more features
 onto them..."<br>
<br>
6. Microsoft Office Starter: Don't know this. The HP and the Dell, came with:- <br>
a) Microsoft Office (MO) full version (nag-ware)<br>
b) Microsoft Works - a full office suite but limited in comparison to
MO. I think you would find the restrictions irksome if use to full MO.<br>
c) Microsoft Wordpad - a pathetic word processor I blunder into and regret dealing with.<br>
<br>
So I installed OpenOffice. I think you may have this on the expiring
Fujitsu. I like and use this all the time. I use v3.2 not a later
version. They changed one of the settings I used for printing booklets.
So I reverted back to v3.2.<br>
<br>
7. Other Freeware stuff<br>
<br>
The freeware cleanup tool that I use at least weekly is CCleaner. Among many other things, it cleans the registry.<br>
<br>
Useful freeware sites that I rely on include http://www.snapfiles.com and http://www.filehippo.com/<br>
<br>
Just glancing at the complete filehippo list, I note that I have got
quite a few of the programs (listed below) on my PC, many of them used
very regularly; though not all downloaded from filehippo:-<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alarm Clock<br>
